# Analysis-of-unemployment-and-employment-by-sex-and-educational-attainment-in-Bulgaria-and-the-EU
## Abstract
In this paper, we examines the relationship between the level of education and sex on the labor market through the main indicators such as the level of employment and unemployment in Bulgaria.
Analyzing this influence, the main conclusions for the improvement of the labor market as a main factor for the development of the economic system and the reduction of social disparities are indicated.
The report uses a period for analysis between 2009 and 2022 by quarter, examining the situation in Bulgaria in the context of the EU.

## 1. Introduction
The efficiency of the labor market is a basic condition for the efficient functioning of the entire economic system. The global crisis of 2008 and Covid 19 led to a crisis in the economies of almost all countries, including EU member states. The problems related to the disproportions in the labor market caused the need to strengthen the role of the state in regulating and mitigating the consequences of the crisis. It is important that policies implemented in the field of the labor market and education in Bulgaria are effective. An important condition for achieving this efficiency is the correct assessment of the labor market in Bulgaria and the factors affecting it. This is achieved through the study of certain indicators creating an opportunity to identify problem areas in comparison with other EU member states. The main task of this article is to examine the labor market in Bulgaria in the context of demographic structures, gender and education through the method of comparison and analysis, comparing it with the labor markets of other EU member states using objective indicators.
## 1.1 Content
### 1. Step one. Loading and tidy
#### In this step, we familiarize ourselves with the data, its parameters and elements. Basic manipulations will be performed to help us use and better understand the elements to continue the research in the next steps. It includes the following manipulations:
- loading the databases
- extraction of uniqueness by features and observations
- basic information about the data
- checking and removing punctuation marks
- rename columns
### 2. Step two. Missing values
#### In this step, missing values analysis is done. The goal is to examine their proportions, check for a pattern, and remove them where appropriate:
- general check for missing data
- searching for a pattern in the missing data
- check for Outliers in missing data
- targeted removal of missing data
### 3. Step three. Precessing
#### In this step, we create the possibility of transformations of the data in different form and its best visualization
- filter by items, observations
- feature filtering
- adding a column with the full names of the countries and remove "geo" feature with their abbreviations
- rearrangement of features with periods for greater logical sequence
## 3. Methodology
The article methodology uses data from Eurostat, as the main source of statistical economic data describing the economies of EU member states as well as their main trading partners. The article methodology uses also the developed methodology of Eurostat as the content of the indicators, measurement units, demographic structures and groups and time intervals.

The definitions of employment and unemployment, as well as other survey characteristics follow the definitions and recommendations of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The updated definitions of the labour status are part of the new Integrated European Social Statistics Framework Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/1700) and its Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2240 for the labour market domain entering into force in 2021. The EU-LFS methodology before 2021 is described in the dedicated EU-LFS (Statistics explained) webpage on methodology, whereas updated definitions of the labour status under IESS are explained in the following EU-LFS (Statistics explained) webpage on methodology from 2021 onwards. The main concepts and indicators related to the labour status are the following:

- Employed persons are all persons who worked at least one hour for pay or profit during the reference week or were temporarily absent from such work. The employment rate is the percentage of employed persons in relation to the total population.
- Unemployed persons are all persons 15 to 74 years of age (16 to 74 years in ES, IT and the UK) who were not employed during the reference week, had actively sought work during the past four weeks and were available to begin working immediately or within two weeks.
- The duration of unemployment is defined as the duration of a search for a job or as the length of the period since the last job was held (if this period is shorter than the duration of search for a job).
    - The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the active population (labour force). The labour force is the total number of people employed and unemployed.
    - The unemployment ratio is the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the total population.
- The active population (labour force) is defined as the sum of employed and unemployed persons. The activity rate is the percentage of active persons in relation to the total population.
- The inactive population consists of all persons who are classified neither as employed nor as unemployed

Unit of measure: The used indicators are reported as rates (employment, unemployment rates). Rates and ratios in the LFS Main Indicators do not correct the denominator for item non-response due to the additional seasonal adjustment step. This can lead to marginal differences in rates and ratios due to rounding in comparison with the same indicators published in the detailed tables section. Due to the continuous update of SA estimates, it has to be noted that SA estimates may slightly differ between historical and current main Indicators tables.
Reference Period: The reference periods are quarters of years.

Coverage - Time: The tables include the break-corrected data (2009Q1-2020Q4) that are produced in the joint correction exercise between Member States and Eurostat, and mostly start in 2009. The UK has not delivered any data under the IESS definitions, and therefore no back-estimates for the UK or the EU28 aggregates can be produced
